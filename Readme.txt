Boost conversions with real-time social proof popups and user activity notifications, encouraging visitor actions on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

### **Boost Conversions with Herd Effects - Social Proof Notifications for WordPress**

**Herd Effects** is a flexible notification plugin that allows you to create custom popups to display simulated or user-defined activities on your website. While the plugin offers the **appearance of social proof**, it does not automatically pull real-time data from your site. Instead, users can create notifications by defining their own variables, such as recent purchases or signups, to simulate activity and drive engagement.

Display **pop-up notifications** for sales, signups, or other actions using customizable templates that capture attention and motivate visitors to act.

### = Key Features of Herd Effects =

*   **Customizable Popup Templates**: Easily create your own notifications using templates with variables like names, locations, or numbers.
*   **Simulated Activity**: Users manually define the data (e.g., recent purchases or signups) to create the appearance of social proof.
*   **Notification Timing Control**: Set intervals for notifications to ensure consistent visibility.
*   **2,000+ FontAwesome Icons**: Choose from over 2,000 icons or upload custom ones to personalize notifications.
*   **Custom Notification Titles**: Personalize titles to match specific actions or events on your site.
*   **Shortcode Support**: Display notifications anywhere on your site using shortcodes.
*   **Advanced Display Settings**: Control visibility based on user activity, screen size, or specific devices.
*   **GDPR Compliant**: Cookie-free operation to ensure compliance with privacy laws.
